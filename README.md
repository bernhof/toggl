*This library has just begun development, and lacks maturity in tests, API surface coverage and more, so pull requests are welcome! :-)*

# Toggl .NET Client
An unofficial .NET client library for v9 API for Toggl time tracking (http://toggl.com).

Note that V9 of the Toggl API is currently [still in development](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/api_v9_repots_v3_basics.md). See https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs for Toggl's official API documentation. Most still only covers the v8 API at the time of writing.

# Asynchronous
This library is **built for asynchronous code**, but also provides auto-generated synchronous methods for convenience.
